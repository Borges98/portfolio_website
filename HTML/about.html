        <p>
            I have recently graduated from San Francisco State University with my Bachelors of Science in Computer Science, which has been my passion since I was a Freshman in high school. 
            I enjoy Frontend development the most, and I hope that in the future I can work with React, SASS, TypeScript or JavaScript more in my career. My dream job is somewhere where I can contribute to creating highly impactful products that reach a large audience. 
            In my free time, you can find me gaming with friends or at Golden Gate park touching grass.
